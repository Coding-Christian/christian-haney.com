            <p class="text-justify">
              I grew up in San Diego, CA and have been passionate about math and science from a very young age, thanks to my intelligent, loving, and supportive parents.
              I excelled in STEM classes throughout grade school and eventually moved to Irvine, CA to pursue a BS in Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.
              At UCI, I worked hard to hone my laboratory skills and explore my interests. I made many friends along the way, some of which were pursuing degrees in Computer Science.
              After listening to my friends talk with excitement about their expreiences learning programming, I decided to take an Python course to see for myself.
              The course taught us about simple functions and writing algorithms, and ended with a brief introduction into some of the libraries Python had to offer that added additional functionality to the language, like graphics and advanced mathematics.
              By the end of the course, I had thouroughly enjoyed learning about Python and the problem solving opportunities being a programmer presented.

              I went on to graduate with my BS in Chemistry and a 3.294 GPA, which eventually led me to a contracted Chemical
              Technician position at HP, back in San Diego.
              After about 9 months at HP, I knew I had an important decision to make. In order to continue my career in the field of
              Chemistry, I would have to return to school to earn a graduate degree and qualify for the higher level positions.
              On the other hand, I could pursue the passion for programming that I had discovered at UCI. I knew both would have their costs and risks, but I could not miss this opportunity to pursue my passion.
              I began researching accelerated programs for beginner programmers and discovered LearningFuze in Irvine. I attended an info session and was in awe of the dedication and kindess the staff showed both their students and alumni.
              I was confident that LearningFuze would be able to offer me the tutelage and support I needed to make the transition between careers.

            <p class="text-justify">
              During my 12 weeks at LearningFuze, I spent about 700 hours learning web development alongside 18 other bright and eager minds with the help of professionals with decades of experience.
              I was excited to learn full stack skills, from UI and UX design to databases and data structures, and how these concepts helped people create the websites we use every day.
              I got to work on both solo and group projects that familiarized myself with some of the most popular languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools.
              I took a special liking to React, for its ability to make the creation of dynamically changing websites easy and readable, and to Node, for its use in writing intuitive APIs in the familiar syntax of JavaScript.
              Since the end of the program, I have continued to work on fleshing out some of the projects I worked on during my time at LearningFuze and am proud of where I stand today.
              The path to web developer has been long and winding, but what I have learned about myself and the world along the way has been indespensible.

            <p><b>Background:</b>
              Fresh! Cooking Assistant was the first fully realized, full-stack application I worked on.
              Team Lead, Samantha Nagle, wanted to create an app to help users pick out good produce and provide some other useful information, such as storage tips and recipes.
              It was decided that the app would be built in React and PHP to build out our knowledge, since we had recently learned these skills.
              Along with my teammates, I explored new tools and utilities, such as React Router DOM, that I had not been exposed to before.
              As back-end lead, I was able to create an API with several endpoints to send and retrieve data from our MySQL database.
              I wrote endpoints to handle the gathering of produce and recipe information, as well as store and manage user data, like saved produce and recipes.

            <p><b>Background:</b>
              Cellar Door served as my introduction into back-end design from the ground up.
              The app originally started out as the Student Grade Table, a project I built during my time at LearningFuze.
              The original version of the app was based off of an existing, PHP back-end from a previous project.
              I wrote a new API in Node with the help of the Express.js and mysql libraries, in order to gather practice with back-end design.
              One advantage that Express.js offers for handlling HTTP requests is simple routing.
              HTTP requests can be routed to different parts of the API script based off of request path and method, without the need for explicitly written conditional checks.

              JoJo's Bizarre Matching Game is one of the first applications I designed.
              The matching game was a project assigned during my time at LearningFuze, that I continued developing after the program.
              The matching game served as my primary introduction to the front-end topics of UX, animation, and event handling.
              jQuery provided a relatively painless way to manipulate CSS classes used for animation as well as modify event handlers on elements such as the cards.
              The transitions built in to CSS made it easy to create simple animations, espcially the dealing and flipping of the cards.
